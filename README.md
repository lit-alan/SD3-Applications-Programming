# SD3-Applications-Programming

This module is designed to equip learners with features required to build comprehensive and highly responsive Java applications.

On completion of this module the learner will/should be able to

1. Deploy appropriate theory, practices and tools for the implementation of robust Java solutions.
2. Select and implement measures to enable multithreading in order to make applications more responsive and interactive.
3. Select and implement measures to manage and process large quantities of data.
4. Critically evaluate client/server applications.

The module is 100% assessed by continuous assessment of laboratory/workshop based assignments and assessments. The module will be delivered through a combination of lectures, lab-lectures and practical classes. The lectures and lab-lectures will drive the content which will then be reinforced in the practical classes. Self-directed learning will be strongly encouraged throughout this module.
